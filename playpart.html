<div>_[calls out from his room]_.</div> Is that my little lark twittering out
there?

<div id ="name">NORA</div>
<div>_[busy opening some of the parcels]_.</div> Yes, it is!

<div id ="name">HELMER.</div>
Is it my little squirrel bustling about?

<div id ="name">NORA</div>
Yes!

<div id ="name">HELMER.</div>
When did my squirrel come home?

<div id ="name">NORA</div>
Just now. <div>_[Puts the bag of macaroons into her pocket and wipes her
mouth.]_</div> Come in here, Torvald, and see what I have bought.

<div id ="name">HELMER.</div>
Don’t disturb me. <div>_[A little later, he opens the door and looks into
the room, pen in hand.]_</div> Bought, did you say? All these things? Has my
little spendthrift been wasting money again?

<br><div id ="name">NORA</div>
Yes but, Torvald, this year we really can let ourselves go a little.
This is the first Christmas that we have not needed to economise.
<br>

<div id ="name">HELMER.</div>
Still, you know, we can’t spend money recklessly.
